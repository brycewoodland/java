# Learning Java: A Personal Journey

This repository documents my learning path, experiences, and progress as I dive deeper into mastering Java. I have prior experience with languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, and TypeScript but now I’m focusing on Java. You have to start somewhere.

Starting in 2024, I’ve set a personal goal to get better with Java, building both small and larger projects.

## Current Activity

### Palindrome Checker

## Plans and Project Ideas

Starting simple with practical examples and gradually building more complex applications.

### 3. Palindrome Checker
Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

### 4. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Implement a function to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given number of terms.

### 5. Prime Number Checker
Build a program that checks if a given number is prime.

### 6. Temperature Converter
Develop a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### 7. File Reader and Writer
Create programs to read from and write to text files.  
Support for file manipulation, like appending or editing content.

### 8. Command-Line To-Do List
Implement a simple to-do list app where users can add, remove, and list tasks in the terminal.

### 9. Basic Image Processing
Implement image processing features like resizing, cropping, or converting between formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) using libraries like Java AWT.

### 10. Build a Simple HTTP Server
Create a basic HTTP server that serves static files (HTML, images) using raw Java sockets.  
Support for handling GET requests and MIME types (text/html, image/png).

### 11. Simple Database Interface (SQL with JDBC)
Write a Java application to interact with a SQL database, performing CRUD operations.  
Use libraries like JDBC or ORM frameworks like Hibernate.

### 12. Basic Web Scraper
Create a simple program to scrape data from a website using Java (possibly with the Jsoup library).

### 13. Basic Command-Line Password Manager
Implement a command-line password manager to securely store and retrieve passwords.

### 14. Simple Encryption/Decryption
Create a program that uses simple encryption algorithms, like Caesar Cipher or XOR, to encrypt/decrypt text.

### 15. Basic Java Design Patterns
Implement some well-known design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.) in Java.

### 16. Building a Simple Chat Application
Implement a basic chat application using Java Sockets for client-server communication.

### 17. JUnit Testing
Develop some of the above programs with JUnit tests to get familiar with testing in Java.

### 18. Java Collections Framework
Deep dive into Java's built-in collections: Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues.  
Implement custom data structures using the Collections Framework.

## Larger Projects

Once you’re comfortable with smaller projects, aim for bigger projects:

### 1. Spring Boot Application
Build a REST API using Spring Boot to manage a simple resource, such as a To-Do list or a book collection.  
Learn about RESTful web services, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate for database access.

### 2. Full-Stack Application
Use Java for the back-end with Spring Boot and connect it to a front-end (could be a simple HTML/JavaScript UI or using something like React).

### 3. Contribute to an Open-Source Project
Find a Java-based open-source project and start contributing. This is a great way to learn from real-world code, work with others, and improve your skills.

## Additional Resources to Consider
- Codewars or LeetCode for problem-solving.
- Java EE for learning enterprise Java development (if you're interested in building more scalable systems).
- Apache Maven for learning how to manage dependencies and build Java applications.

## Kotlin Learning Goals

Since Kotlin is closely related to Java and fully interoperable with it, I've decided to explore Kotlin as well. Here are some initial goals:
- Understand Kotlin Syntax - Learn the basics of Kotlin, including variables, functions, and control flow.
- Work with Null Safety - Explore Kotlin's null safety features to avoid NullPointerException.
- Explore Kotlin Coroutines - Understand how to use coroutines for asynchronous programming.
- Interoperability with Java - Practice calling Java code from Kotlin and vice versa.
- Android Development - Experiment with building a simple Android app using Kotlin.
- Kotlin Standard Library - Learn about Kotlin's built-in functions and utilities.
- Build a Small Kotlin Project - Implement a simple application, such as a task manager or a unit converter, in Kotlin.

By integrating Kotlin into my Java learning journey, I can expand my versatility and improve my skills in modern JVM-based development.

### Is Kotlin related to Java?
Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning that Kotlin can run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and use Java libraries. Kotlin improves upon Java by offering more concise syntax and additional features, such as null safety and coroutines for asynchronous programming.
