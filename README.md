# Learning Java: A Personal Journey

This repository documents my learning path, experiences, and progress as I dive deeper into mastering Java. I have prior experience with languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, and TypeScript but now I’m focusing on Java. You have to start somewhere.

Starting in **2024**, I’ve set a personal goal to get better with Java, building both small and larger projects.

## Plans and Project Ideas

Starting simple with practical examples and gradually building more complex applications.

### 1. Basic CLI Calculator
Implement a simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

### 2. Reverse String
Write a program that takes a string input and reverses it.

### 3. Palindrome Checker
Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

### 4. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Implement a function to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given number of terms.

### 5. Prime Number Checker
Build a program that checks if a given number is prime.

### 6. Temperature Converter
Develop a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### 7. File Reader and Writer
Create programs to read from and write to text files.
- Support for file manipulation, like appending or editing content.

### 8. Command-Line To-Do List
Implement a simple to-do list app where users can add, remove, and list tasks in the terminal.

### 9. Basic Image Processing
Implement image processing features like resizing, cropping, or converting between formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) using libraries like [Java AWT](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/package-summary.html).

### 10. Build a Simple HTTP Server
Create a basic HTTP server that serves static files (HTML, images) using raw Java sockets.
- Support for handling GET requests and MIME types (text/html, image/png).

### 11. Simple Database Interface (SQL with JDBC)
Write a Java application to interact with a SQL database, performing CRUD operations.
- Use libraries like [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/) or ORM frameworks like [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/).

### 12. Basic Web Scraper
Create a simple program to scrape data from a website using Java (possibly with the [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) library).

### 13. Basic Command-Line Password Manager
Implement a command-line password manager to securely store and retrieve passwords.

### 14. Simple Encryption/Decryption
Create a program that uses simple encryption algorithms, like Caesar Cipher or XOR, to encrypt/decrypt text.

### 15. Basic Java Design Patterns
Implement some well-known design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.) in Java.

### 16. Building a Simple Chat Application
Implement a basic chat application using Java Sockets for client-server communication.

### 17. JUnit Testing
Develop some of the above programs with JUnit tests to get familiar with testing in Java.

### 18. Java Collections Framework
Deep dive into Java's built-in collections: Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues.
- Implement custom data structures using the Collections Framework.

## Larger Projects

Once you’re comfortable with smaller projects, aim for bigger projects:

### 1. Spring Boot Application
Build a REST API using Spring Boot to manage a simple resource, such as a To-Do list or a book collection.
- Learn about RESTful web services, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate for database access.

### 2. Full-Stack Application
Use Java for the back-end with Spring Boot and connect it to a front-end (could be a simple HTML/JavaScript UI or using something like React).

### 3. Contribute to an Open-Source Project
Find a Java-based open-source project and start contributing. This is a great way to learn from real-world code, work with others, and improve your skills.

## Additional Resources to Consider

- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for problem-solving.
- [Java EE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html) for learning enterprise Java development (if you're interested in building more scalable systems).
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for learning how to manage dependencies and build Java applications.

## Questions to Reflect On

1. **Would it make sense to use Java in some of my CS courses?**
   - Java is widely used in academia, so using it in courses makes sense for teaching object-oriented principles, design patterns, and algorithms. You might also integrate Java in teaching about database connectivity and web development.

2. **Would a Larger Project be appropriate in Java?**
   - Java is great for larger projects, especially in the enterprise space. It could be useful for building applications with a front-end/back-end structure, such as a Java-based web service (using Spring Boot) or a large-scale data processing app.

3. **Should I Contribute to an Open-Source Project?**
   - Absolutely! Java has a rich ecosystem, and contributing to open-source Java projects can accelerate your learning and help you engage with the community.

By following this structured learning path, I aim to gradually build up my knowledge and practical experience in Java. I’m excited to learn, grow, and contribute to the broader Java community.

Good luck with your journey, and enjoy the process!
